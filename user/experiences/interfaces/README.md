# User interfaces

Here we define the component of the most commonly used user interface patterns in decentralized identity, and give general guidelines about their contents, with the aim of maintaining a coherent user experiences across the ecosystem. These include components present in the identity apps as well as the relying vertical apps and transitions between the two. We focus on use cases that have the most volume of usage and value flowing through them.

Some common use cases include first time setup of identity apps (including identity-box and primary identity setup), first time setup of the vertical apps (including first identity connection to an app and agreements), subsequent logins, connection management, and a few specialized functions such as money account selections, etc.
