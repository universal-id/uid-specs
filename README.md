# PoC specifications

This is a preliminary version of the specifications used in the Proof of Concept (PoC) stage, where we attempt to prove technology feasibility and mitigate technical risks. As the project evolves details of this document will eventually appear in the main product specifications.

The Universal Identity specs site contains organized and detailed information specifying the functionality and experiences of Universal Identity as an identity system protocol as well as a set of interfaces users interact with.

> Notice: The contents of this repository will be merged with the Universal Identity website under [https://universal.id/specs](https://universal.id/specs). Currently they are hosted through GitBook under [https://poc.specs.universal.id](https://poc.specs.universal.id).
